# Backend Express.js  Templates

This README provides an overview of the backend setup using Express.js, running on port 3000, and using the command to start the server. Additionally, it includes instructions for managing environment variables using a .env file.

    
    npm run dev


Prerequisites
Before running the backend server, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

. Node.js
. npm (Node Package Manager)

<h2>Installation </h2>
1 .Clone the repository to your local machine:

    git clone <repository-url>
2.Navigate into the project directory:

    cd <project-directory>

3.Install dependencies using npm:

# Configuration

Ensure that your application's configuration settings are properly configured. Typically, these settings include database connection strings, API keys, and environment variables.

<h3>Running the Server </h3>
To start the backend server, use the following command:

    npm run dev

This command will start the server using nodemon, which will automatically restart the server whenever changes are detected in the code.

<h3>Accessing the Application </h3>
Once the server is up and running, you can access the application by navigating to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

<h3> Development</h3>
During development, you may want to make changes to the codebase. Remember to restart the server after making changes to see the effects.

<h3>Deployment</h3>
Before deploying your application to a production environment, make sure to:

Set environment variables appropriately.
Update configuration settings for production.
Run tests to ensure everything is working as expected.
